# PaillierCryptosystem
Implementantion of Paillier Cryptosystem, a probabilistic asymmetric algorithm for public key cryptography.

This code was presented as my final project for Discrete Mathematics, it uses some shortcuts and math tricks to make it shorter than the standard algorithm with exactly the same results.
It has a simple menu, everything over terminal because there's no need for a GUI, it's quite self-explanatory to use and completely commented.
Entirely made by me, you're free to modify it as you please but set this repository as reference.
